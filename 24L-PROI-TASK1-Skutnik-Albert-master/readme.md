# Fraction

An example of the autonomous class `Fraction` representing a common fraction.
The numerator and denominator are integers with values in the `long long` range.

The solution consist of projects:
* _FractionLib_ - library containing `Fraction` class,
* _FractionUnitTest_ - unit tests for `Fraction` class,
* _FractionApp_ - example application that uses `Fracrion` class.

## Task

There is a full `Fraction` class declaration in the project. Complete the implementation of the class methods.
When implementing public methods, please use private methods of the class and remember not to duplicate code.
Complete the tests, there should be at least a few tests for each public method.
Please pay attention to check the boundary values.
